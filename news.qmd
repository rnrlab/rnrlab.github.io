### August 21, 2023 - New Paper Alert!

It took some time, but our new method for whole genome and metagenomes DNA amplification is just published in **NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics**: <https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/5/3/lqad073/7246555>

![](images/m_lqad073figgra1.jpeg)This work was led by [\@CarlosDOC\_](https://twitter.com/CarlosDOC_), with the participation of [\@karmayoral](https://twitter.com/karmayoral) from the lab. We were also very fortunate to be able to count on the collaboration of Dr. Concei√ßao Egas from [Biocant-CNC](https://cnc.uc.pt/en/people/c-egas) (Portugal).

In this work, we used the [piPolB](polb.html#pipolb) to develop new methods for whole genome and metagenome amplification (WGA). We used the piPolB in two different protocols: (1) piPolB MDA and (2) piMDA, with piPolB in combination with a Œ¶29 DNA polymerase (Œ¶29DNAP). In short, the second proved to be a great protocol, outperforming all previously available methods. In particular, our **piMDA** method (piPolB + Œ¶29DNAP) provides not only high DNA yield but also a very competent and unbiased coverage for [sequences with high GC content]{.underline}, usually the Achilles heel of most MDA methods.

Along the way, we found that piPolB is capable of *ab initio* DNA synthesis, without DNA primers or templates. This activity has been described before for other polymerases, especially thermoresistant enzymes, but it is often neglected in the literature. *Ab initio* DNA synthesis by piPolB is negligible for optimized piMDA methods, but is of importance for piPolB *solo* amplifications. Ongoing work aims to understand how this spurious DNA synthesis is regulated and control it to developing improved piPolB-base MDA methodologies.

We have performed deep sequencing and a detailed comparison of non-amplified samples with samples that were amplified with piPolB MDA and piMDA, with and without a previous alkaline denaturation step. Additionally, we compared the piPolB-based methods with two commercially available kits based on Œ¶29DNAP, namely RepliG (Qiagen) for Random-Primers MDA and TruePrime (4BaseBio) for a primase-based MDA.

All in all, we can conclude that piMDA methods enable proficient WGA of a wide range of genomes for downstream applications, including those related to the study of microbiome diversity in different environments, especially in environments where high-GC microorganisms, such as halophiles or thermophiles, would predominate. In addition, our results suggest that piMDA has great potential for application in microbiome studies involving DNA amplification, such as those using single-cell metagenomics to reconstruct strain-resolved genomes of microbial communities at once, at the risk of missing poorly represented sequences with high GC content.

Finally, we would like to dedicate this work to the memory of Professor Margarita Salas, for her long and inspiring support in our careers and for her seminal contributions to the discovery of piPolB and the early development of this project.
