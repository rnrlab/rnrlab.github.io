#### Modesto Redrejo Rodríguez (PI, Associate Professor) [![](figs/orcid.png){width="16"}](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0014-4162) [![](figs/scopus-logo.png){width="16"}](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12791769600) [![](figs/rg.png){width="16"}](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Modesto-Redrejo-Rodriguez) [![](figs/wos.png){width="16"}](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/D-7247-2012) [{{< iconify fa6-brands x-twitter >}}](https://twitter.com/mredrejo "@mredrejo")

Modesto is Associate Professor (in Spanish "Profesor Permanente Laboral") at the Biochemistry Department of the School of Medicine of one of the largest universities in Madrid, the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid ([UAM](#0)).

Since his PhD thesis, working on DNA repair mechanisms of ASFV (large DNA virus), he has been very interested in DNA replication and repair mechanisms and how these mechanisms evolved. After that, he moved to the [Murat Saparbaev's lab](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/mechanisms-dna-repair-and-carcinogenesis-lab-members) at the Gustave Roussy Institute (Villejuif, nearby Paris) to work on *Base Excision Repair* enzymes. Then, in 2011, he moved back to Madrid as Postdoc and later on Senior Research Associate in the Margarita Salas' lab at the Molecular Biology Center ([CBM](https://www.cbm.uam.es/en/)) where he focused in prokaryotic models of DNA replication. After moving to the UAM in 2018 as Assistant Professor to start the R'n'R Lab, he was promoted to Associate Professor in November 2023.

He is very interested in the use of multidisciplinary approaches, using biochemistry, structural biology, genetics and bioinformatics to deal with biological problems. A full list of Modesto's publications can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/modesto.redrejo%20rodriguez.1/bibliography/public/).

#### Juan J. Arredondo Lamas (Associate Professor)

Juan is a very experienced researcher in genetics and molecular biology of model organisms, particularly *Drosophila melanogaster*. After several months of sharing the lab with us and providing very interesting "outsider" discussions, he decided to join the crew. He will be very helpful in the students' supervision and focus in the biological role of pipolins.

#### Carmen Mayoral Campos (PhD Student, 2019- )[{{< iconify fa6-brands x-twitter >}}](https://twitter.com/karmayoral "@karmayoral")

Carmen is graduated in Biology and MSc in Biomolecules and Cell Dynamics (UAM). She is working in structure-function studies of piPolB, focused on understanding DNA priming capacity of these new DNA polymerases.

#### Víctor Mateo Cáceres (PhD student, 2019-)

Víctor started his BSc thesis working on the biological role of piPolBs in bacteria. His project involved the characterization of a piPolB mutant in the context of a naturally occurring pipolin from *E. coli*. However, during the Covid19 lockdown, he decided to switch into a Bioinformatics project and then enrolled in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. During the first year of his Master he got a "Collaboration Fellowship" that will help us to finish the [ExplorePipolin](https://github.com/pipolinlab/ExplorePipolin) pipeline.

His PhD project focus in the phylogenetic and functional characterization of pipolins, combining computational and "wet lab" approaches.

#### Eduardo D. Lozano Escobar (PhD Student, 2023-)

Eduardo completed his Master's Thesis in 2023-24, focusing on novel lactic bacteria genomes in collaboration with Dr. Antonia Picón's laboratory (INIA-CSIC). He was awarded a FPU PhD scholarship to return to the lab in early 2025 as PhD student. His PhD thesis project aims to analyze the transcriptomics of betatectivirus to further understand the virus-host relationship at the molecular level.

#### Kilian Rueda Bolaño (MSc Student, 2025)

Kilian has a BSc Degree in Microbiology and is currently studying a Master's Degree in Virology (\@UCM). His MSc Thesis aims to provide the first insights into new defense functions in pipolins. His work is part of a collaboration with José A. Escudero ([MBA lab](https://ucm.es/mbalab), \@UCM).

#### Juan Carlos Ramírez Montans (MSc Student, 2025)

Juan Carlos, a biochemist from UEx, is currently working with us on his Master's thesis in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at UAM. He is employing a multidisciplinary approach that includes structural and sequence comparisons to analyze the diversity of viral TPs and uncover their evolutionary history.

#### Laura Ferrer Vazquez (BSc Student, 2025)

Laura is currently in her last year of BSc Degree in Biochemistry. Her work is related with the role of piPolB in DNA damage tolerance in *E. coli*.
