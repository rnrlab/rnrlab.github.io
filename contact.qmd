## The lab By Metro

The lab is 10 min walk from the Bego√±a Metro Station (Exit to *San Modesto*). Follow the dashed line to the Biochemistry Department door. The arrow indicates a shortcut using a small door to the Medicine Campus.

Once inside the Campus walk straight until you find the big building of the School of Medicine.
